<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yunce Zhang [CN: 张云策], a first-year CE Ph.D at NEU. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University. Here is my [Resume](./Resume.pdf). I was fortunate to work with Prof. Fan Zhang at Zhejiang Univerisity with Dr.Cheng Wei and Dr.Qianmei Wu.

I have a broad interest in Hardware Security and Side-Channel Attack(SCA). Specifically， i am passionate about Masking schema against SCA and SCA with machine learning，Special Channel SCA.

If you have anything you want to ask me or talk about, please <a href="mailto:yunce.zhang.sec@gmail.com">email me</a> directly. Writing a personal homepage is a bit boring. :)
